\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank Henrik Nilsson for his help and guidance throughout my

examiners, Brian Logan and Simon Thompson, provided an extensive and detailed
feedback that helped to improve the thesis. I am grateful to Joey Capper and
Neil Sculthorpe for reading and commenting on early drafts of this thesis. I
am also grateful to Mari Chikvaidze and Kate Demirtas for proofreading several
